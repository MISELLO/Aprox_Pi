# Aprox_Pi
A way to get an aproximate value of pi generating random points.

The idea is to generate random points inside a square.
This square has a circle inscribed inside it.
If we divide the number of points inside the circle, by the total points generated
and multiply it by 4 we optain a number that aproximates Pi.
